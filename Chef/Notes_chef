git remote set-url origin https://username@github.com/user/repo.git

I just got the same problem and just figured out what's cause.

Github seems only supports ssh way to read&write the repo, although https way also displayed 'Read&Write'.

So you need to change your repo config on your PC to ssh way:

edit .git/config file under your repo directory
find url=entry under section [remote "origin"]
change it from url=https://MichaelDrogalis@github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git to url=ssh://git@github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git. that is, change all the texts before @ symbol to ssh://git
Save config file and quit. now you could use git push origin master to sync your repo on GitHub

ssh-keygen-->Copy id_rsa.pub to settings->SSH and GPG keys-> github

git config --global user.email "your_github_email_@email.com"

git config --global user.name "Your full name"

2.) ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:asantoya/projectnewbies.git'
git push -f origin master  or git push --force

git pull --rebase             # to retrieve upstream changes, replay yours on top
git push --dry-run --verbose origin HEAD:master   # always good idea: dry-runs..
git push origin HEAD:master   # actually push current branch head (non-master) to upstream master


3.) Pull is not possible because you have unmerged files.
git merge
vimdiff

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull
Explanation above mentioned Command:

Fetch will download everything from another repository, in this case, the one marked as "origin".
Reset will discard changes and revert to the mentioned branch, "master" in repository "origin".
Pull will just get everything from a remote repository and integrate.

4.) [vobadm@devops1 chef-repo]$ git pull -u origin master
Enter passphrase for key '/home/vobadm/.ssh/id_rsa':
A way to solve this is with ssh-agent and ssh-add:

$ exec ssh-agent bash
$ ssh-add
Enter passphrase for ~/.ssh/id_rsa:
