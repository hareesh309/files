• Configuration and management of amazon RDS database, read replica and backup scheduling. 
 Creating RDS with Multi-AZ and Read Replica for high availability 


S3
• Configured S3 buckets with various life cycle policies to archive the infrequently accessed data to storage classes 
based on requirement. 
• Created S3 buckets in the AWS environment to store files, sometimes which are required to serve static content 
for a web application. 
• Good knowledge of storage option like EBS, S3, Glacier.
 Create and configure S3 bucket with restricted polices and S3 lifecycle(Glacier) 
 Take caring of data encryption stored in s3 buckets 
 Cost optimization in storage using life cycle management(Glacier) Creating S3 buckets and upload the data into particular buckets 
 Hosting static website and deploying updated contents using versioning 
 Recording object level activity using the cloud trail data events feature  
 Maintaining server level access logging  
 Hands on experience CloudFront to access the data by users with low latency and with secure 
 Maintaining DNS management using Route53 
 Managing Receive Notifications when specific events occur in buckets using SNS service 
 Hands on Experience on cross region replication 
• Create/Managing buckets on S3 (CLI) and store db and logs backup, upload images for CDN serve. 



VPC
• Experienced in creating multiple VPC's and public, private subnets as per requirement and distributed them as groups into various availability zones of the VPC. 
• Configuration and implementation of VPC endpoint, peering & VPN connection.
• Created NAT gateways and instances to allow communication from the private instances to the internet.
  Established peering connections between VPC'S  
 

IAM
• Used IAM for creating roles, users, groups and implemented MFA to provide additional security to AWS account 
and its resources. 
 • Used security groups, network ACL's, internet gateways and route tables to ensure a secure zone for organization in AWS public cloud. 
• Experience in IAM to create new accounts, roles, groups and Policies 
 
 Route 53
• Implemented domain name service (DNS) through route 53 to have highly available and scalable applications. 
• Create/Managing buckets on S3 and store DB and logs backup, upload images for CDN server. 
• Used Cloud Watch logs to move application logs to S3 and create alarms raised by applications. 
 Migrating and managing DNS entries in Route53 
• Creating/Managing DNS records on Amazon Route 53 and go-daddy panel. 





ELB
• Created Highly Available Environments using Auto-Scaling, Load Balancers, and SQS. 
• Knowledge and implementation of elastic load balancing and auto scaling and policy. 
• Set up Elastic Load Balancers for different applications to ensure high availability of applications.
• Set up Auto Scaling Groups based on CPU to adapt to unforeseen spikes without having an outage or needing manual intervention. 
 Designing and deploying highly scalable infrastructure using ELB and Auto scalling 

 



Other Services:
• Knowledge of Elastic Beanstalk, SNS, SQS, Elastic cache, Kinesis. 
• Experience in Cloud Watch service, Cloud trail for monitoring and Auditing AWS resources.
